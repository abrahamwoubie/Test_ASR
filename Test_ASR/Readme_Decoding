# Please run the following scripts consecutively to generate the lattice files.

# The scripts and outputs of the decoding are found in Decoding folder

1. Generate_Lattice.sh # It generates a lattice and writes the generated lattice file (i.e., lat.1.gz) to ./exp/DNN/decode/

2. Use the following script to compute the WER
	
	./score_kaldi.sh ./data/test/ ./exp/DNN/graph/ ./exp/DNN/decode/ # It displays the best WER, details about 
	the WER (i.e., per utterance and per speaker)
		
	We can modify the values of min-lmwt,max-lmwt, stage, decode_mbr and word_ins_penalty values.

	The Word error rates for different configuration parameters are found ./exp/DNN/decode/
	The results breakdown per speaker and per word label are found in ./exp/DNN/decode/scoring_kaldi/
	The log-likelihood scores for each file is found ./exp/DNN/decode/scoring_kaldi/penalty_0.0/log/

3. I used the following binary to file to get the acoustic likelihood and language model costs.
	
	../../src/latbin/lattice-1best --lm-scale=14.0 "ark:gunzip -c . ./exp/DNN/decode/lat.1.gz|" ark:- | \
	../../src/latbin/nbest-to-linear ark:- ark,t:./acoustic_and_language_model_costs/out.alignment \
	ark,t:./acoustic_and_language_model_costs/out.transcription ark,t:./acoustic_and_language_model_costs/out.lm ark,\
	t:./acoustic_and_language_model_costs/out.am

	The output files are found in ./acoustic_and_language_model_costs/
