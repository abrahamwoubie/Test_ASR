HELP COMING RWANDA
PLANES FLY TO
PLANES DOCTORS
THEY FOOD WATER AND MEDICINE TO PEOPLE RWANDA
RWANDA IS A COUNTRY
COUNTRY HAD A WAR
MANY PEOPLE LEFT THEIR HOMES
SOON THEY RAN OUT FOOD CLEAN WATER
PEOPLE GOT SICK
MANY PEOPLE DIED
NOW PEOPLE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE GONE TO AFRICA
THEY TO HELP RWANDANS GET WELL AND RETURN TO THEIR HOMES
MOST PEOPLE RWANDA ARE FARMERS
SOME FARMERS GROW GROW BANANAS RAISE CATTLE
MOST GROW ONLY ENOUGH FOOD FEED THEIR OWN
CHILDREN START SCHOOL THEY SEVEN YEARS OLD
BEFORE WAR MANY CHILDREN COULD NOT GO SCHOOL
SCHOOLS IN RWANDA DID NOT HAVE ROOM ALL CHILDREN
PEOPLE TRAVELED ON DIRT ROADS TO MAKE A MARKETPLACE
AT THEY FIND THINGS THEY NEED CAN'T MAKE GROW THEMSELVES
THERE GORILLAS LIVING IN
N GORILLAS ARE
BEFORE WAR MANY PEOPLE CAME TO RWANDA TO SEE GORILLAS
RWANDA IS ONE SMALLEST COUNTRIES AFRICA
LAND ROCKY HAS MANY HILLS
VOLCANOES MADE SOME HIGH THERE TOO
A AY AY N STUDIED EMPEROR PENGUINS IN
HE FOUND OUT HOW BIRDS KEEP THEIR BABIES WARM
EMPEROR PENGUIN MOTHER LAYS AN EGG WINTER
FATHER PUTS THE EGG FEET
HE COVERS IT A BIG ROLL BELLY FAT
MANY PENGUIN FATHERS GATHER A BIG CIRCLE
THEY SNUGGLE TOGETHER TO BLOCK
THEY KEEP THE EGGS WARM UNTIL BABY PENGUINS BREAK OUT THE EGGS
AFTER CHICKS HATCH PARENTS TAKE TURNS KEEPING THEM WARM
IS CONTINENT AT SOUTHERN END OUR PLANET
COLDEST PLANET EARTH PLACE EARTH
THICK ICE SNOW COVER ALL TIME
ONLY A FEW PLANTS N EH IN MIDDLE THE COLD CONTINENT
N ALONG COAST NEARBY OCEANS
PENGUINS ARE GOOD SWIMMERS
BUT THEY CAN NOT FLY
OUT WATER PENGUINS MUST WADDLE HOP ACROSS ICE
SO PENGUINS OFTEN SLIDE ON THEIR BELLIES INSTEAD WALKING
SHEATH BILLS LINE ON SUMMER
THEY DIVE FOOD NEARBY WATERS
SHEATH BILLS HAVE HARD HARD COVERING CALLED A SHEATH ON THEIR BILLS
CRABEATER SEALS ARE SEALS LAND
THEY SPEND MOST THEIR TIME WATER
A THICK LAYER OF FAT CALLED BLUBBER KEEPS SEALS WARM GIVES THEM ENERGY THEY CAN NOT FIND FOOD
COLD WATER NEAR
THEY SHY FISH ARE ICE
THEY EVEN HAVE BLOOD
WATCHING TELEVISION BAD EH HEART
BE BAD YOU TOO MUCH DOCTORS SAY
SOME DOCTORS ASKED KIDS HOW MUCH EXERCISE THEY GET
DOCTORS FOUND THAT MANY KIDS DO NOT RUN JUMP PLAY OUTDOOR GAMES AS THEY SHOULD
KIDS TELEVISION PLAY VIDEO GAME INSTEAD
DOCTORS SAY KIDS NEED GET UP MOVE ABOUT
THEY NEED TO EXERCISE THEIR HEART OTHER PARTS THEIR BODIES
THE HEART A MUSCLE
EXERCISE HELPS KEEP HEART OTHER MUSCLES STRONG
MANY NATIVE ARE TRYING TODAY TO KEEP THEIR ALIVE
THEY IN HOMES LIKE OTHER THEY GO TO SAME SCHOOLS
FREE TIME THEY SAME GAMES T V PROGRAMS THAT ELSE DOES EVERYONE ELSE DOES
MANY NATIVE CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT TRADITIONS THAT PEOPLE THEIR HAVE HAD MANY GENERATIONS
LEARN SONGS STORIES
THEY ALSO LEARN ABOUT SPECIAL FOODS ARTWORK
THEY SOMETIMES LEARN SPEAK A NATIVE
SOME PEOPLE WORK EXTRA HARD TO BE SURE THEY THEIR TRADITIONS ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
THEY TRAVEL EVERYWHERE TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT THESE TRADITIONS
ONE NATIVE TRADITION IS TOTEM POLE CARVING
OFTEN PEOPLE PASS TRADITION DOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN
CHILDREN WATCHED FATHERS SOME TIMES THEIR GRANDFATHERS GREAT GRANDFATHERS CARVE TOTEM POLES
FIRST THEY FIND A TREE THAT BE CUT
THEY REMOVE THE BARK TREE MAKE IT INTO A POLE
THEN THEY DRAW THE OTHER MARKINGS ON POLE
SHARP TOOLS ARE USED CARVE POLE
THEY START AT POLE AND CARVE DOWN TO BOTTOM
WHEN IS FINISHED POLE
THEN OIL SPREAD ALL OVER POLE
OIL USED TO KEEP POLE FROM CRACKING
TAKES ONE MONTH CARVE ABOUT TEN FEET POLE
THERE ARE A OF SYMBOLS MAY TAKE LONGER
MOST TOTEM POLES ARE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY FEET HIGH
TOTEM POLE MAY BE HIGH AS NINETY FEET
MANY ANIMAL SIGNS BE FOUND ON THESE POLES AS PART HISTORY
SOMETIMES THESE ANIMALS STAND THAT PEOPLE LIKED TO DO
AT TOTEM POLES ARE SOLD TO PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THEM AND TO MUSEUMS
THERE A CRIME IN ALASKA SOMEONE ROBBED HARMED
TWO BOYS HAVE PUNISHED THAT
THEY ARE MEMBERS INDIAN TRIBE
JUDGE LEADERS TRIBE DECIDED TOGETHER WHAT PUNISHMENT WOULD BE
BOYS ARE BEING SENT TO ALONE ISLANDS OFF COAST
EACH BOY WILL COMPLETELY ALONE FOR TWO YEARS
EACH HAS TO BUILD A PLACE TO
THEY WILL NEED TO CUT AND HUNT FOOD
THEY WILL TO FIND TOOLS TO CATCH KILL THEIR PREY
TRIBE LEADERS WILL COME R TIME TO TIME TO SEE THEY ARE OKAY
THESE ARE ONLY PEOPLE THEY WILL SEE TWO YEARS
CHEETAHS ARE THE FASTEST ANIMALS WORLD
SAY THAT THEY MAY BE EXTINCT SOON
YEARS AGO THERE WERE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND OF THEM PARTS AFRICA ASIA
TODAY THERE ARE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND OF THEM
THEY ARE DISAPPEARING LAND THEY NOW BEING USED FARMS FACTORIES
THEY ARE ALSO KILLED BY SOME OF FARMERS BECAUSE THEY KILL FARM ANIMALS
SOME PEOPLE KILL THEM GET THEIR SKINS TO MAKE COATS OTHER THINGS
CHEETAH BABIES ARE KILLED BY LIONS HYENAS BEFORE THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO DEFEND THEM EH
MANY YEARS STATES AND RUSSIA WORKED SEPARATELY GOING SPACE
RUSSIANS TOOK THREE YEARS AGO BY SENDING THE FIRST ASTRONAUT SPACE
AFTER THAT A FIRST NEIL WALKED MOON
WORK ACHIEVE THESE GOALS HAS PEOPLE TWO COUNTRIES MUCH MONEY
NOW THEY CANNOT SPEND THESE LARGE AMOUNTS MONEY FOR SPACE
BECAUSE U S RUSSIA WILL NOW COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS MANY COUNTRIES
THEY WILL BUILD A SPACE STATION WHERE ASTRONAUTS AROUND WORLD WILL BE ABLE WORK
LIFE ON SPACE STATION IS VERY FROM WE ARE USED
MOST IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T MUCH OUTER SPACE
FORCE ATTRACTS THINGS SURFACE
WITHOUT ON EARTH YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WALK
YOU MIGHT BOUNCE OR YOU WOULD FLOAT
SEVERAL PROBLEMS SPACE
ASTRONAUTS DON'T EAT FOOD THAT MAKES CRUMBS SINCE THEY WOULD FLOAT AROUND SPACE STATION
THEY A VACUUM CLEANERS TO RID ANY CRUMBS
DROPS WATER A SHOWER ARE ALSO A PROBLEM
THEY HAVE A SHOWER ROOM A DOOR THAT CLOSES A VACUUM CLEANER GET WATER OFF THEIR BODIES AFTER THEY FINISHED
ASTRONAUTS STRAP THEIR FEET TO FLOOR THEY TOILET OR SHOWER
MANY EH MAKE LIFE EASIER SPACE
AFTER THEY ARE USED SPACE PEOPLE SOMETIMES FIND THEM EH USEFUL EARTH AS WELL
ASTRONAUTS DRINK MILK FROM ALUMINUM FOIL POUCHES
POUCHES COME FILLED WITH POWDER SO THEY BE STORED LONG PERIODS TIME
WHEN SOMEONE A DRINK THEY ADD WATER POUCH THEIR CHOICE
HAVE ALWAYS HAD VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AIR SUPPLIES

BUTTERFLIES LAY EGGS ON PLANTS
AFTER A BUTTERFLIES FORM
LET MOST THEM FLY AWAY
THEY KEEP A FEW BUTTERFLIES CAGES LAY MORE EGGS
BUTTERFLIES INSECTS
THEY HAVE SIX LEGS
BUTTERFLIES OW EVERYWHERE WORLD
RAIN HAVE MOST KINDS BUTTERFLIES
BUTTERFLIES EAT ONLY NECTAR
NECTAR JUICE FLOWERS

THEY HELP GET WELL RETURN TO THEIR HOMES
MANY PEOPLE RWANDA ARE FARMERS
SOME FARMERS GROW GROW AE N OR RAISE CATTLE
MOST GROW ONLY ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THEIR OWN
CHILDREN START SCHOOL THEY SEVEN YEARS OLD
BEFORE THE WAR MANY CHILDREN COULD GO SCHOOL
SCHOOLS IN RWANDA DID NOT HAVE ROOM ALL CHILDREN
PEOPLE TRAVEL DIRT ROADS TO MAKE A MARKETPLACE
AT THEY FIND THINGS THEY NEED CAN'T MAKE MAKE GROW THEMSELVES
THERE THERE GORILLAS LIVING RWANDA
MOUNTAIN GORILLAS ARE
BEFORE WAR MANY PEOPLE CAME TO RWANDA SEE GORILLAS

A SCIENTIST STUDIED EMPEROR PENGUINS IN
HE FOUND OUT HOW THE BIRDS THEIR BABIES WARM
EMPEROR PENGUIN MOTHER LAYS EGG IN WINNER
FATHER PUTS EGG HIS FEET
HE COVERS WITH A BIG ROLL BELLY FAT
MANY PENGUIN FATHERS GATHER IN A BIG CIRCLE

THEY KEEP EGGS WARM UNTIL BABY PENGUINS BREAK OUT EGGS
AFTER CHICKS HATCH THE PARENTS TAKE TURNS KEEPING THEM WARM
AH THE N IN SOUTHERN END OUR PLANET
IT COLDEST PLACE ON EARTH
THICK ICE SNOW COVER ANTARCTICA ALL TIME
ONLY A FEW PLANTS INSECTS IN MIDDLE COLD
ANIMALS LONG ALONG THE COAST NEARBY OCEANS
PENGUINS GOOD SWIMMERS
THEY NOT FLY
OUT WATER PENGUINS MUST WADDLE HOP ACROSS ICE
SO PENGUINS OFTEN SLIDE ON THEIR BELLIES INSTEAD WALKING
LINE ON DURING DURING SUMMER
THEY DIVE FOOD NEARBY WATERS
SHEATH BILLS HAVE A HARD COVERING CALLED A SHEATH THEIR BILLS
CRABEATER SEALS ARE FASTEST SEALS LAND
THEY SPEND MOST THEIR TIME IN WATER
A THICK LAYER FAT CALLED BLUBBER KEEPS SEALS WARM GIVES THEM ENERGY THEY CAN NOT FIND FOOD
IN COLD WATER NEAR
SHINING FISH ICE
THEY EVEN HAVE BLOOD
WATCHING TELEVISION BAD HEART
CAN BE BAD YOU TOO MUCH DOCTORS SAY
SOME DOCTORS ASKED KIDS HOW MUCH EXERCISE THEY GET
DOCTORS FOUND MANY KIDS DO NOT RUN JUMP OR PLAY OUTDOOR GAMES OFTEN THEY SHOULD
KIDS TELEVISION PLAY VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD
DOCTORS SAY KIDS NEED TO GET UP MOVE ABOUT
MANY NATIVE ARE TRYING TODAY TO KEEP THEIR ALIVE
THEY IN HOMES LIKE OTHER AND THEY GO TO SAME SCHOOLS
ON THEIR FREE TIME THEY SAME GAMES T V PROGRAMS THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES
MANY NATIVE LEARN ABOUT TRADITIONS THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR HAVE HAD MANY GENERATIONS
LEARN SONGS STORIES
HEY ALSO LEARN ABOUT SPECIAL ARTWORK
AND THEY LEARN TO SPEAK A NATIVE LANGUAGE
SOME PEOPLE WORK EXTRA HARD BE SURE THEIR TRADITIONS ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
THEY TRAVEL EVERYWHERE TO TEACH OTHERS ABOUT THEIR TRADITIONS
ONE NATIVE AH TOTEM POLE CARVING
OFTEN PEOPLE PASS THEIR TRADITIONS DOWN THEIR CHILDREN
CHILDREN WATCHED THEIR FATHERS THEIR GRANDFATHERS GREAT GRANDFATHERS CARVE AH EH TOTEM POLES
FIRST THEY FIND A TREE THAT CAN BE CUT
THEY REMOVE BARK TREE MAKE A POLE
THEN THEY DRAW OTHER MARKINGS POLE
SHARP TOOLS USED TO CARVE POLE
THEY START AT POLE CARVE DOWNWARD BOTTOM
WHEN CARVING FINISHED POLE
OIL SPREAD ALL OVER POLE
OIL USED KEEP POLE CRACKING
TAKES ONE MONTH TO CARVE ABOUT TEN FEET OF POLE
THERE ARE A SYMBOLS IT MAY TAKE LONGER
MOST POLES ARE BETWEEN FORTY FEET HIGH
A OW POLE MAY BE HIGH AS NINETY FEET
MANY ANIMAL SIGNS CAN BE FOUND POLES PART OF THEIR HISTORY
THESE ANIMALS STAND PEOPLE LIKED TO DO
AT TOTEM POLES ARE SOLD TO PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THEM AND TO AE
THERE A CRIME IN ALASKA WHERE SOMEONE ROBBED HARMED
TWO BOYS HAVE PUNISHED FOR
THEY ARE MEMBERS OF INDIAN TRIBE
A JUDGE AND THE LEADERS TRIBE DECIDED TOGETHER WHAT PUNISHMENT WOULD BE
BOYS ARE BEING SENT ALONE ISLANDS OF COAST
EACH BOY WILL COMPLETELY ALONE TWO YEARS
EACH HAS TO BUILD A PLACE TO
THEY WILL NEED TO CUT HUNT FOOD
THEY WILL HAVE FIND TOOLS TO CATCH KILL PREY
A TRIBE LEADERS WILL COME FROM TIME TIME SEE THEY ARE OKAY
THESE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY WILL SEE TWO YEARS
ARE THE FAST ANIMALS WORLD
SAY THEY MAY BE EXTINCT SOON
YEARS AGO THEY WERE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND THEM PARTS AFRICA ASIA
TODAY THERE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND THEM
THEY ARE DISAPPEARING THEY LAND THEY IS NOW BEGINNING USED FARMS FACTORIES
SOME PEOPLE KILL THEM GET THEIR SKINS MAKE COATS OTHER THINGS
CHEETAH BABIES KILLED BY LIONS HYENAS BEFORE THEY OLD ENOUGH TO DEFEND THEM
MANY YEARS AY STATES RUSSIA WORKED SEPARATELY GOING INTO SPACE
RUSSIANS TOOK THREE YEARS AGO BY SENDING THE FIRST ASTRONAUT SPACE
AFTER THAT A FIRST WHEN NEIL WALKED THE
WORK ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AT HAS PEOPLE TWO COUNTRIES MUCH MONEY
NOW THEY CANNOT SPEND THESE LARGE AMOUNTS MONEY FOR SPACE RESEARCH
EH RUSSIA WILL NOW THEIR EFFORTS WITH OF MANY COUNTRIES
THEY A SPACE STATION WHERE ASTRONAUTS FROM AROUND WORLD WILL BE ABLE WORK
LIFE SPACE STATION VERY WE ARE USED
MOST BECAUSE THERE ISN'T MUCH IN AH SPACE
FORCE ATTRACTS THINGS TO EARTH'S SURFACE
WITHOUT GRAVITY ON EARTH YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WALK
YOU MIGHT BOUNCE OR YOU WOULD FLOAT
SEVERAL PROBLEMS SPACE
ASTRONAUTS DON'T EAT FOOD THAT MAKES CRUMBS SINCE THEY WOULD FLOAT AROUND SPACE STATIONS
THEY USE VACUUM CLEANERS TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS
DROPS WATER IN A SHOWER ARE ALSO A PROBLEM
THEY HAVE A SHOWER A DOOR THAT CLOSES A VACUUM CLEANER TO WATER OFF THEIR BODIES AFTER THEY ARE FINISHED
ASTRONAUTS THEIR FEET TO FLOOR WHEN THEY USE TOILET OR SHOWER
MANY AY EH MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR ASTRONAUTS SPACE
THEY ARE USED SPACE PEOPLE SOMETIME FIND THEM USEFUL ON EARTH AS WELL
ASTRONAUTS DRINK JUICE MILK UW AH FOIL POUCHES
POUCHES COME FILLED POWDER SO THEY BE STORED LONG PERIODS TIME
SOMEONE A DRINK THEY ADD WATER POUCHES EH CHOICE
THE ASTRONAUTS HAVE HAD VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AIR SUPPLIES
THESE AIR TANKS ARE NOW BEING USED HERE EARTH
FIREFIGHTERS USED TO HAVE VERY HEAVY AIR TANKS THAT DIFFICULT TO AROUND
THEY SO HEAVY THAT SOME PEOPLE USE
TOO SO THE ASTRONAUTS AIR SUPPLY SYSTEM NOW USED
ASTRONAUTS NEED DRILLS THAT ARE VERY THEIR WORK IN SPACE
THEY HAVE A CORDLESS DRILL THAT RUNS ON BATTERIES
PEOPLE ON EARTH NOW HAVE CORDLESS VACUUM CLEANERS DRILLS
A SPACE STATION MANY PARTS
A SPACE SHUTTLE THE FIRST PIECE OF STATION POSITION SPACE
HE ASTRONAUTS WORK FIVE YEARS BUILDING REST STATION
STATION SIX ASTRONAUTS WILL BE ABLE TO THERE AT ONE TIME
MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY AT THAT STATION FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS
PARTS WHERE THE ASTRONAUTS ARE CALLED
WHILE AT STATION THEY WILL WORK ON SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS DAY
THERE WILL BE THREE SCIENCE LABS
OTHER EXPERIMENTS WILL BE OUT OUTSIDE STATION
SOLAR PANELS WILL COLLECT ENERGY NECESSARY EH SPACE STATION
NOISE IS ALL AROUND
EXAMPLE THINGS THAT MAKE NOISE DAY ARE ALARM CLOCKS HAIR DRYERS FIRE TRUCKS JET PLANES LOUD MUSIC
BUT LOUD NOISES CAN BE HARMFUL
TOO MUCH LOUD NOISE HARM EARS
DOCTORS SAY MORE THAN TEN MILLION PEOPLE AY STATES HAVE HEARING PROBLEMS BY LOUD NOISES
SOME DOCTORS SAY THEY ARE SEEING MORE HEARING PROBLEMS THAT KIND
SOME KIDS LEARNED THAT EVERYDAY NOISES CAN HARM THEIR EARS
THERE WERE SPECIAL MACHINES THAT KEPT TRACK NOISY THEY HEARD EACH DAY
SOME NOISES WERE VERY LOUD
SOUND KIDS YELLING SCHOOL BUS CAN BE LOUD ENOUGH HARM KIDS' EARS
NOISE MADE BY VIDEO GAMES CAN DO HARM ALSO
EARS PICK UP SOUNDS MADE BY MANY THINGS
SOUNDS MAKE TINY HAIRS DEEP EAR MOVE
THOSE HAIRS SEND MESSAGES YOUR BRAIN
THEN YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU WHAT SOUNDS HEARING
LOUD NOISES CAN BE HARM TINY HAIRS EAR
NOISE MIGHT MAKE SOME OF THOSE HAIRS
THEN YOU CAN HEAR WELL AS YOU USED HEAR
ONE LOUD NOISES ARE LIKE STRONG
