1. Create a vocabulary list for the training set showing the number of times each word occurs, and sort by frequency of occurrence.

	To do this task, simply run the following python command

	python Generate_Vocabulary.py List.txt

	The script Generate_Vocabulary.py is the python script file i created to do question number 1. While the input to the script is the lab        el files, the outputs are the sentences.txt and the word_and_frequency.txt found in the Sentences and Vocabulary folders, respectively.

	List.txt is the list of files to be processed.

	The python scripts are found in the SoapBox folder.

2. Create a dictionary for the vocabulary list, showing the phonetic breakdown of each word, in lowercase.

	To do this task, run consecutively the following two python scripts

	Generate_Word_and_Phone_Files.py List.txt Generate_Lexicon.py List.txt

	The script Generate_Word_and_Phone_Files.py generates two files from each label file. These are the word (.word) and phone( .phone) fil        es found in Words and Phones folders, respectively.

	The script Generate_Lexicon.py List.txt generate the lexicon files by comparing the start and end times of the word and phone files fou        nd in Words and Phones folders. This generates lexicon files in Lexicon folder (*.dict) that correspond to the label files.

	Then, I merged the *.dict files in Lexicon folder to generate one dictionary file using the following awk command

	for i in ./Dict_Files/*.dict; do cat "$i" >> Lexicon.dict; done

	See Lexicon.dict found in the folder Dict_Files to see the output of the above awk command

	Finally, I used the following awk command to display only one word and its corresponding transcriptions (i.e. remove the repetitive wor        ds in the Lexicon.txt)

	sort -k1,1 -u ./Lexicon/Lexicon.txt >> Lexicon_Final.dict

	This generate the final dictionary file in Dict_Files (i.e., Lexicon_Final.dict)

3. Provide some stats about the training set â€“ number of speakers, unique sentences, etc. I used the following awk command to generate the sentence with the number of speakers.

	cat ./Sentences/sentences.txt | awk ' { tot[$0]++ } END { for (i in tot) print tot[i],i } ' | sort >> Sentences_Stat.txt
